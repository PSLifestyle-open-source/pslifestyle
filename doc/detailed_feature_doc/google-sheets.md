# Google Sheets

## Overview

## ID generation

Applicable to:

- Questions
- Actions
- Feedback

Steps:

1. Copy-paste following
   formula: `=CONCAT(DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(0, 4294967295), 8),DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(0, 4294967295), 8))` to any empty cell
2. Copy the value generated (for example, E463927A7DED7CCA)
3. Paste the value to the ID column under desired row 4. Keyboard: CTRL+SHIFT+V 5. Mouse: Right click -> Paste Special -> Value only

## Questions

Questions are used during questionnaire, for the purpose of collecting information about the user, to determine their
carbon footprint.

They are stored in sheets with country code as a name. (FI, EE, SI, etc).

After synchronization to Firestore, they are placed into `questions` collection.

Structure:

| Column name                                  | Field name in Firestore                       | Example                                                                                                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Every question takes more than 1 row, as each question has more than one choice which can be selected (but only one can
be selected at the time). When the row is just another choice for the previous question, only following columns should
have set a value:

- Choice text
- Choice text (Language name)
- Choice value

## Constants

Constants are variables used as part of scope during calculations or evaluation of formulas
for [questions](./questionnaire.md#calculations) and [actions](./actions-and-plan.md#action-impact-calculation)

They are managed in `Constants` sheet, where each country has own column, and each constant has own row.

| Column name             | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constant name           | Name of the constant. This name can be used in formulas                                                                    |
| Default                 | Default values for variables. If country does not have country-specific value for specific variable, this one will be used |
| FI / SI / TR / PT / etc | Column per country. Country-specific values for variables                                                                  |

## Actions

Actions are used to promote different actions to users, to help them to reduce their carbon footprint.

They are stored in sheets with naming convention: `{COUNTRY_CODE}_ACT_2`. (FI_ACT_2, EE_ACT_2, SI_ACT_2, etc).

Combinations of CONDITION+FORMULA are separated by comma (,). Each condition can include multiple conditions in it which then work in OR manner, and those are separated by semicolon (;).

## Feedback options

Feedback options are options users can select when they try to submit feedback form.

They are stored in sheets with naming convention: `{COUNTRY_CODE}_FeedbackCard`. (FI_FeedbackCard, EE_FeedbackCard,
SI_FeedbackCard, etc).

Structure:

| Column name                 | Example                | Description                                    |

| Order number                | 1                      | Order in which the option will be displayed    |

## Static translations (email)

Emails are managed in GSheet as well.
They are synced to translation files only.

## Data synchronization to Firestore

All master data used inside the app, which are not translations, are synchronized to Firestore manually.
