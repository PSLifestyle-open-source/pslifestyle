    "paragraph1": "A planetary health diet is a diet that is optimal for human health and environmental sustainability. The diet can be symbolically represented by half a plate of fruits and vegetables and the other half consists of whole grains, plant proteins, oils and modest amounts of meat, dairy, sugars and starchy vegetables. The diet meets the nutritional requirements and helps lower the risk of several diseases such as diabetes, heart and metabolic diseases, certain types of cancer, and inflammation.",
    "paragraph2": "According to this diet, Finns could eat a lot of vegetables, fruits and legumes. For example beans, lentils and nuts can be consumed even six times more than nowadays. On the other hand, Finns overconsume unhealthy amounts of meat, refined grains and sugar. Meat consumption should be limited to only 20 % of the current levels. Finns can still have their meat stew (or some other traditional meat food, which country partners can specify) but the adjustment will just be enjoying it as a treat once a week. Also, other animal products don’t have a big role, but 1,5 eggs per week, a glass of milk per day and fish twice a week can be consumed.",
